## Ten-Tick - Purchase Tennis Tickets Online
Ten-Tick is a Single-Page Application (SPA) that allows you to purchase tickets (ticks) for tennis (ten) matches happening all over the world at any given day. You don't have to go through the hassel of being at the stadium at the right time or standing in long, tiring queues to get the tickets. You have the comfort of sitting in your home and booking the ticket for the matches you would love to go to

## Project Timeline
Uzair implemented this project in his 2021 Summer break as a rising final-year Computer Science & Software Engineering Student at LUMS. It took him over two weeks learning modern ReactJS concepts and then over a week implementing this app

## App Complexity
The app, quite holisticly, tries to cover all the main elements of an advanced basic React app. It covers the following:
* Multiple components & props
* Component state management
* Built-in React hooks (useState, useParams, useHistory)
* Custom React hooks (useFetch)
* React Router (BrowserRouter, Swtich, Route, Links)
* Firebase back-end (realtime DB)

## Ten-Tick Features
Ten-Tick gives you the following features thorugh the series of components that are rendered at the page one after another, according to the stage of your ticket booking process:
* See and choose from all tennis matches happening today
* See available tickets left for each of the matches
* See total seating capacity of the stadium
* Book tickets (if still available)
* Buy snacks (popcorns, energy drinks, chewing gums, carbonated beverages, non-alcoholic drinks, chocolates)
